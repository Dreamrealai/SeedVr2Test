# SeedVR2 Setup Status

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Frontend**: Modern HTML/CSS/JS interface deployed to Netlify
   - URL: https://seedvr2test.netlify.app/
   - Features: Video upload, resolution selection, progress tracking
   
2. **Infrastructure**:
   - RunPod Pod: `lh0wm9g482zr28` (H100 PCIe) - RUNNING
   - Google Cloud Storage bucket: `seedvr2-videos` - Created
   - Service account and credentials - Configured

3. **Code Structure**:
   - Cleaned up duplicate files
   - Organized project structure
   - Created deployment scripts

### ❌ Missing/Issues

1. **SeedVR2 Model Not Deployed**
   - The RunPod pod is running a generic PyTorch image
   - SeedVR2 models and code are NOT installed
   - Need to either:
     a) Install SeedVR2 on the existing pod, OR
     b) Create a RunPod serverless endpoint with custom Docker image

2. **Backend API Not Running**
   - No backend service to bridge frontend and RunPod
   - The frontend expects an API at a specific URL but nothing is deployed

3. **Model Availability Issue**
   - The original SeedVR2 repo states "The open-source process is under review"
   - Model weights may not be publicly available yet on Hugging Face

## What You Need to Do Next

### Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended for Testing)
1. **Deploy a simple backend API**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install flask flask-cors google-cloud-storage
   
   # Run the backend locally or on a cloud server
   python simple-backend.py
   
   # Use ngrok to expose it publicly if running locally
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

2. **Update frontend API URL**:
   - Edit `script.js` line 2
   - Replace `API_BASE_URL` with your backend URL

### Option 2: Full RunPod Setup
1. **SSH into your RunPod pod**:
   ```bash
   # First, add your SSH key
   runpodctl ssh add-key
   
   # Then connect (this might not work directly)
   # You may need to use RunPod web console
   ```

2. **Install SeedVR2 on the pod**:
   - Clone the ByteDance SeedVR repo
   - Install dependencies
   - Download model weights (if available)
   - Start the inference server

3. **Create RunPod Serverless Endpoint**:
   - Build custom Docker image with SeedVR2
   - Deploy as serverless endpoint
   - Update frontend to use endpoint URL

## Critical Issues

1. **Model Availability**: The SeedVR2 models may not be publicly available yet. Check:
   - https://huggingface.co/ByteDance-Seed/SeedVR2-3B
   - https://huggingface.co/ByteDance-Seed/SeedVR2-7B

2. **RunPod Integration**: The current pod is not configured for SeedVR2. You need to either:
   - Manually install everything via SSH/console
   - Create a proper serverless endpoint

3. **Backend Service**: No backend is currently running to handle requests from the frontend.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Check Model Availability**: Visit the Hugging Face links to see if models are available
2. **Deploy Backend**: Use the simple-backend.py as a starting point
3. **Test Integration**: Once backend is running, test the full flow
4. **Setup RunPod Properly**: Follow the ByteDance SeedVR setup guide when available
